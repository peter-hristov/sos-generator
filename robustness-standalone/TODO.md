# Optomise memory:
done - Remove the polygons and colours from PlotWidget
done - remove  - data->arrangementFiberComponents.resize(data->arrangementFacesIdices.size(), -1);

Use direct pointers in uion find? Don't think it could work though



# Tasks
Done - Compute the arrangement of a number of line segments
Done - Traverse the half-edge arrangement data struture (use ccb and twin)
Done - How to see where the segment came from? Use with_history and originating curve
Done - Set up IDs for the faces (use a map for now, store ID field in data later)
Done - Get a running BFS
Done - Lower and upper star for each edge (loop all tets, maybe we don't need a big datastruture)
Done - Compute fibers in each face
Done - Compute preimage graph for each face
Done - Compute connectivity of fibers for each face (via disjoint set)
Done - Compute fiber fiber components assignemtns (make sure differnt sheets show the same)
Done - Compute the Reeb space
Done - Colour the sheets in the range
Done - Flexible fibers

Use better startegy to find fiber components.
Use better maps between various handles and indices and so on.



Later
- Can you tell the algo which segments have the same point? Does that help?
- How do we use rational numbers for precision? Robustness.






















### TODO

Resurrect volume projection.

Write paper.






### DONE
Use OpenMP.
Fix projected triangles when changin u,v fields
Cache histogram and scatterplot.
Make sure you have a consistent logic about deleting FSCP points and you don't do too much work.
Toggles for FS/IS visibility and Union/Intersection.
Add Carthesian grid and 0 lines.
Update object selection.





### Backlog

Do the u and v scalar fields.
Crop & downsize domain.
Recompute min/max values for every field
Change isovalueSpinBox on isofield change



Deal with raw pointers in Data.h






### Key New Features

# Most Important for Now
Once you click an object it is locked and shown

Click objects show only them on the plot accross different timesteps

Selecting one object (via clicking) 
Single object evolution.

Export dat


# Tracking Over Time
Get triangles as output.

# Eventually
Exporting Features

# Bugs
Opacity does not work well.

Isotime



### Crasy Ideas
Abstract Fiber surface (distance functions over other things)

    Add dynamic clipping for dimensions via the qt interface.
    Simplify by removing points or flattening the distribution for the isosurface scalar field.


### NOTES

# Optimisation
    Compute Scatterplot Faster -> to do with weird mem access
    Volumes Take 10s to compute, figure out why. Is it memory access again?
    I got over a second speedup for just not processing unused cubes;
    There is a MAJOR problem with distance field computation. Over 12s on full data. I cannot get it down significatly more with this method.

    Quite alot of time is spent on just reading from the 2D arrays in the PlotWidget for example in getting the FS distance values and computing the histogram

# Things which are slow and I cannot easily solve:

    Scatterplot                     - memory access is slow
    Volumes                         - not sure, probably related to memory access
    Distance Field                  - voronoi diagram GPU z-buffer algorithm
    Isosurface                      - (flexible and octrees and paralle)

# Notes on Optimisation
    Skipping empty triangles gave a 0.9s speedup.
    Went from 0.9s to 2.6s when we go from 0 triangles to 1,587,894 triangles.
